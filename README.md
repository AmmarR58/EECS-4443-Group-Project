# EECS-4443-Group-Project
## Overview
**GestureIT** is a custom Android application designed for exploring gesture-based controls as an alternative to traditional mobile interactions. This research-driven project investigates whether gesture inputs can improve **usability**, **ergonomics**, and **resource efficiency** on smartphones.

Extended smartphone usage can lead to repetitive strain and digital fatigue. GestureIT aims to address these issues by enabling intuitive, user-defined gestures to perform common actions (e.g., launching Chrome), potentially reducing physical strain and speeding up navigation.

## Key Features
- Define and save custom gestures to trigger app launches.
- Built using Android Studio.
- Performance & battery usage tracked using **Android Profiler**.
- Compatible with Android **SDK 24–35**.

## Experimental Design
A **2x3 within-subjects user study** was conducted with 12 participants (age 18–24), comparing GestureIT with traditional navigation across:

- **Task Completion Time**
- **Battery Consumption**
- **User Satisfaction**

### Statistical tests used:

- **Paired t-test** for task time & battery
- **Wilcoxon signed-rank test** for satisfaction

## Findings (Highlights)
- Faster task times using GestureIT vs traditional methods.
- High user satisfaction with gesture controls.
- Battery usage showed minimal difference, warranting further investigation.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repo and extract gesturefinal.zip.
2. Open the project in Android Studio (v2024.3.1 or newer).
3. Connect a compatible Android device or use an emulator.
4. Build and run the app.
